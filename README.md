# CryptoTradingBot
This repository was initially based on the python code provided at https://medium.com/geekculture/building-a-basic-crypto-trading-bot-in-python-4f272693c375. I am now working on other features.

Files description;
* utils: folder that contains python files with functions to be imported
* notebook.ipynb: jupyter notebook that the code was basically copied from the Medium article and pasted
* notebook-bollinger.ipynb: jupyter notebook that imports the funcions_bollinger.py script and applies the crypto trading bot. This is the notebook that contains my own functions and ideas!
* binance_client: jupyter notebook to just check some functionalaties from the python binance package: https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
* study.ipynb: jupyter notebook to just study some Technical Analysis concepts, like moving averages, MACD, RSI and Bollinger Bands
